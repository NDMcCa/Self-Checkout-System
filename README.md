Here is, for viewing, two iterations of a project I participated in while in SENG 300. Classes in the "hardware" package were provided and no one on the team made any changes to them. Software was designed to follow the observer/listener pattern and followed a design pattern that partitioned class structure based on major functionality of the system.

There are some outstanding bugs that were not resolved but were found in testing.

My own contributions were primarily in the "attendant" package, associated testing classes, and maintaining clean code standards across all classes within the project and also contibuted to earlier versions of the payment package. The original project is stored in a repository I personally do not own, although it may still be public for viewing.
