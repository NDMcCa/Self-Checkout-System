Here is, for viewing, two iterations of a project I participated in while in SENG 300. Classes in the "hardware" package were provided and no one on the team made any changes to them. Software was designed to follow the observer/listener pattern and followed a design pattern that partitioned class structure based on major functionality of the system.

There are some outstanding bugs that were not resolved but were found in testing.
